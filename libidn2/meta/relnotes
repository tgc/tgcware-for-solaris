ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
The upstream release will not build on Solaris < 10 out of the box as it
requires a GNU compatible getopt function and a printf function that
understands %zu.
To work around this the source was re-bootstrapped from the 2.0.3 release tag
with the getopt-gnu and printf-posix modules added to bootstrap.conf.
The bootstrap was done on a Fedora Core 26/x86_64 system and the resulting
source archive was used to build this package.

Note that to make libidn2 and programs using it actually do IDNA mapping
correctly you must be using a locale with support for UTF-8.
